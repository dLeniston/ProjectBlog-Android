### ProjectBlog-Android ###

This Android application is part of a number of prototypes developed as part of a fourth year project.
The application acts as a companion app for the project blog (the repo of which can also be found on my _GitHub_ account).
It allows the edition of project entries through an Android device, the new entries are then reflected on the project blog hosted on
[Heroku](http://dleniston-project-blog.herokuapp.com).
